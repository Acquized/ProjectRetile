As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

3. Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
4. Public or private harassment
5. Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the project maintainers.

### Submission Guidelines
  
##### Submitting an Issue
Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. 
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues. 
Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps (please provide full SLF4J Logs if avaible)  
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you  
* **ProjectRetile Version(s)** - is it a regression?  
* **BungeeCord and Minecraft (Client/Server) Version** - is this a problem with all versions or only specific ones?  
* **Reproduce the Error** - provide reproduce steps (for example "disconnecting sql" - execute report cmd)  
* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?  
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be causing the problem (line of code or commit)  
  
Please keep in Mind that we are enforcing our Issue Guidelines using [GitMagic.io](https://gitmagic.io/). The Issue Guidelines are:

* **Subject** can't be empty  
* **Subject** must contain atleast 4 Characters  
* **Subject** must be shorter than 80 Characters

* **Subject** isn't allowed to end with a Dot

* **Body** must contain Overview of Issue, Motivation for or Use Case, affected Versions, MC Versions, Reproduction Steps and Related Issues. (See first part)  
  
The GitMagic Bot will reply to your Issue if something is Missing. If something is missing, the Issue will be marked with :x:. 
I will not respond until you fixed Parts that are missing. If nothing is missing, GitMaic Bot will mark the Issue as :heavy_check_mark: and i will resolve it.
